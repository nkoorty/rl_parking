## Installation
Make you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) locally installed. In order to install the necessary dependencies, run the following command 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This installs the necessary libraries and Python 3.8, which enables us to harness TensorFlow. Upon installing all the dependencies, activate the environment using
```
conda activate sprl
```
